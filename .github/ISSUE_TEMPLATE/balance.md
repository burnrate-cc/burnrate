## Current State
What's the current mechanic/value you want to change?

## Problem

- Is something unfun even if "balanced"?

## Proposed Change
What specific change do you suggest?

```
Example:
- Current: Escort costs 250 credits
- Proposed: Escort costs 200 credits + 1 rations
```

## Reasoning
Why does this improve the game?

## Potential Side Effects
What else might this affect? Could it create new problems?

## Testing
